# Vision

Vision is an android app that helps users to easily search for movies. Users will select a category they wish then the app displays a list of movies in the category. The user can then click any movie to read more information like the synopsis of the movie, director and actors.
The app also provides a link to watch the movie if the user gets interested with the movie.
